# code-guessing
It looks like there's a hot chance i'll upload stuff here

I am absolutely just copying the vague format of https://github.com/appgurueu/codeguessing.

Notes:
* 56: cg56.py has a carriage return (13) that fails to render properly in some places.  Funnily, it offsets Github's automatic code colouring.  Does not have any assignment operators!  There were some walruses at first, but they have long since been weeded out.
